Caring for someone with cancer, or any chronic illness, is one of the greatest expressions of love. Putting aside the busyness of life to care for one less fortunate can be incredibly rewarding. There are few things we do in our day-to-day lives that benefit others as much. It can also be draining. Doing too much without the support of others can create feelings of resentment that linger long after the crisis is over. Families can nurture, give care, and participate in the healing process. Informed, involved patients and families can offer important information, make better decisions, and improve the quality and safety of care. The best way is to make a list of people who could devote time to care of the patient. Caring for someone at Home being the partner, friend or relative of someone with cancer can be very difficult. Many people refer to the experience as a ‘rollercoaster ride’. The high and low feelings you may go through, including shock, acceptance, fear, relief, anxiety and relief can have a huge impact, both physically and emotionally.
Everyone’s situation is different, and everyone has different ways of coping. Some people find they need to talk through their feelings and fears before they can begin to make plans and decide on practical matters. Others manage better by beginning with the practical things.
